        <h2>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>

            These Terms and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes) are governed by the laws
            of Spain.
          </p>
          <p>
            For users acting in a business or professional capacity (non-consumers), the courts of Madrid,

            objection based on venue or forum non conveniens, to the extent permitted by law.

          <p>
            If you are a consumer, mandatory consumer protection and jurisdiction rules applicable in your place
            of residence may apply and will prevail where legally required. Where those mandatory rules do not
            apply, exclusive jurisdiction remains with the courts of Madrid, Spain.
